*       This is the program that controls the LED bar of the car. It runs on an           *
*       Arduino Nano v3. There is a 1 second delay when the bar comes on to enable        *
*       flashing people that are on their highbeams without blinding them with the bar.   *
*                                                                                         *

*             - The way the program checks for the delay has changed. Now it is based     *
*               on the millis() function. This allows to the loop to continue operating   *
*               even when it is monitoring the time to delay the relay circuit activation *
*             - The Arduino circuitry has been completely reworked, as the previous       *
*               circuit had major design flaws.                                           *
