*       This is the program that controls the LED bar of the car. It runs on an           *
*       Arduino Nano v3. There is a 1 second delay when the bar comes on to enable        *
*       flashing people that are on their high beams without blinding them with the bar.   *
*                                                                                         *

*       v2.1 Patch notes:                                                                  *
*             - I'm assuming because of the extreme current drop, the Arduino is          *
*               receiving a slight pulse rather than a constant current when the high    *
*               beams are on. This means that prevMillis() is often reset before the      *
*               delay is up, and the light bar never turns on.                             *
*             - Other times, the light bar would turn on, but eventually turn off again.  *
*               Pressed for time, this is the version in the car at the moment, there is  *
*               no delay.                                                                 *
